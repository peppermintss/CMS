# Linked List Allocation using FAT (File Allocation Table / Table in Memory)
  Linked List Allocation and FAT are two different methods for organizing and managing files on a computer's storage device.

Linked List Allocation is a method of file allocation that uses a linked list data structure to keep track of the free and used blocks of storage space on the disk. Each file is allocated a sequence of blocks that are linked together in a chain, with each block containing a pointer to the next block in the chain. This method is commonly used in Unix and Linux operating systems.

FAT (File Allocation Table) is a file system that was originally used by MS-DOS and later versions of Windows. It uses a table to keep track of the allocation status of each block of storage on the disk. The table, called the FAT, contains an entry for each block, indicating whether it is free or allocated to a file. Each file is stored in a series of clusters, with the FAT providing a map of the clusters used by each file.

It's worth noting that Linked List Allocation and FAT are two different methods and are not used together. However, both methods are used for managing and organizing files on a computer's storage device.

Advantage :
	-Entire block is available for data.
	-Result the siginificant number of disk seek.
	-Random access time is included.
	
Problems:The entire table must be in memory all the time to make it work. With a 1-TB disk and a 1-KB block size,the table needs 1 biilion entries, one for each of the 1 billion disk blocks. Each entry has to be a minimum of 3 bytes. For spped in lockup ,they should be 4 bytes.
Thus the table will take up 3GB or 2.4GB of main memory all the time . Clearly the FAT idea does not scale well to large disks.

  
# NTFS
NTFS (New Technology File System) is a file system used by the Windows operating system for storing and organizing files on a hard drive or other storage device. It was introduced with Windows NT in 1993 and has since become the default file system for all versions of Windows including Windows 10.

NTFS offers a number of advantages over its ancestor, the FAT (File Allocation Table) file system, including improved security, reliability, and performance. Some of the key features of NTFS include support for larger file sizes and volumes, built-in data duplication and error correction, support for file encryption and compression, and advanced access control and permissions.

Overall, NTFS is a strong and efficient file system that has been widely adopted by Windows users and is widely used in business environments.
